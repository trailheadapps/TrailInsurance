## Upgrade steps from v. 6.2 to v. 7.0 for Native apps

- To upgrade native apps, we strongly recommend creating a new app from the app templates in [the forceios npm package](https://npmjs.org/package/forceios), then migrating the artifacts specific to your app into the new template.

See the [Mobile SDK Development Guide](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-Shared/blob/master/doc/mobile_sdk.pdf?raw=true) for more information.

If you have questions, or encounter any issues, we'd love to hear from you. Post any feedback you have on our [Google+ Community](https://plus.google.com/communities/114225252149514546445).
