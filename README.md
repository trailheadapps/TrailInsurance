## Prerequisites <a name="pre"></a>

In order to experience, and experiment with this sample app you'll need:

1. A working installation of Git.
1. An Apple Computer with Xcode 10.1 (or possibly higher) installed.
1. If you want to install the sample app on a physical iOS device, you'll need an Apple Developer Account.
1. A Salesforce Scratch Org. (More info on that later)

## Source Control Setup <a name="download"></a>

This project makes use of [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules), in addition to Xcode build dependencies to incorporate the SDK. This means you must not only clone this repository, but the submodule repositories as well. If you have not yet cloned this repository, this clone command will clone not only this repo, but the submodules as well.

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/trailheadapps/redwoods-insurance.git
```

If you've already cloned this repository, please initialize the submodules using this command

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Salesforce Metadata Setup <a name="sfMetadata"></a>

The `redwoods-insurance-salesforce` folder in this repository contains _most of_ the neccesary metadata to setup a Salesforce Scratch Org for use with this mobile app. However, there are several manual steps you must accomplish using the Salesforce UI to finalize your scratch org with this metadata:

1. Set up your environment. Follow the steps in the [Quick Start: Salesforce DX](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/projects/quick-start-salesforce-dx) Trailhead Project.

1. If you haven't already done so, authenticate with your dev hub org and provide it with an alias (devHub):

    ```
    sfdx force:auth:web:login -d -a devHub
    ```

1. cd to Salesforce Org Setup folder in a command line:

    ```
    cd redwoods-insurance-salesforce
    ```

1. Create a scratch org and provide it with an alias (redwoods-insurance):

    ```
    sfdx force:org:create -s -f config/project-scratch-def.json -a redwoods-insurance
    ```

1. Push the app to your scratch org:

    ```
    sfdx force:source:push
    ```

1. Create a new Role named `redwoods-insuranceAdjuster`:

    ```
    sfdx force:data:record:create -s userRole -v Name='redwoods-insuranceAdjuster'
    ```

    > _Take note of the UserRoleId that's returned_, it will start with '00E'.

1. Find the default users' ID and assign that user the new Role:

    ```
    sfdx force:user:display
    ```

    > _Identify the users' Id_, it will start with '005':

1. Set the default User's Role to the newly created role:

    ```
    sfdx force:data:record:update -s user -i <<<USER-ID>>> -v "userRoleId=<<<USER-ROLE-ID>>>"
    ```

1. Assign the **redwoods_insurance_mobile** permission set to the default user:

    ```
    sfdx force:user:permset:assign -n redwoods_insurance_mobile
    ```

1. Open your new scratch org, to the communities setup page in a web browser:

    ```
    sfdx force:org:open -p /lightning/setup/SetupNetworks/home
    ```

## Manual steps you must take in your org <a name="sfManual"></a>

The mobile application is configured to allow only Customer Community Login users to log in. You'll need to manually setup, activate and publish a community through the UI.

## iOS App Setup

> _Note_: Salesforce Communities Users can only authenticate to the community they're part of. Thus, when writing apps with the Salesforce mobile SDK for iOS it's best practice to manually set the login host for your application as part of your build.

1. Open the file `info.plist` found in the 'Supporting Files' group in Xcode.
1. Locate the key `SFDCOAuthLoginHost`, which by default says `login.salesforce.com`. Edit the default value, replacing it with the community url you copied down earlier. Please note, while the community url likely starts with `https://` **DO NOT** include the `https://` portion of the URL in this `plist` value.

> Note: The source ships with a valid connected app consumer key. However, if you'd like to use your own, ensure it has the following oAuth scopes:
>
> -   Access your basic information (id, profile, email, address, phone)
> -   Access and manage your data (api)
>     -   Provide access to your data via the Web (web)
>     -   Access and manage your Chatter data (chatter_api)
> -   Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)
>
> Once you have established your connected app, copy the consumer key into the TrailIsurance/bootconfig.plist file using Xcode.

## Xcode Setup <a name="xcode"></a>

To load the project in Xcode, open the redwoods-insurance.xcodeproj file.

This project should build and run on the simulator 'out of the box' if the submodules have been properly initialized. However, if you would like to run this on a physical iOS device, you'll need to specify your Team name in the project's settings.

> Note: If you're running this in the simulator, and everything seems really slow, check to ensure you've not accidentally toggled 'Slow Animations' in the Debug menu of the simulator app. It's hotkey is `Cmd-t`, so it can be accidentally toggled fairly easily.
